For the first set of test cases I provided valid entries into the function
and expected the correct outcomes, this was to test that the function actually 
works and functions as expected.

For the second set of test cases I tested to see if spaces were read by the function
to make sure that the space character was included in what counted as a character.
For the end result I also expected the correct number of characters.

For the third set of test cases I tested to make sure that special characters
in a string counted toward the end count, this is important if special characters
are included that they should count. For the end result I expected the output of the final
character count to be correct.
