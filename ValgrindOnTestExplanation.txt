The output that Valgrind printed when analyzing the testing functions reported
that there were no memory leaks. There were, however, 826 bytes still in use at exit
for the heap summary. As well as 29 allocations, 5 frees, and 2,890 bytes allocated.
Even run with --leak-check=full there were no leaks found.
