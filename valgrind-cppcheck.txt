The cppcheck output means that a couple booleans (!fp)
that are redundant and there are multiple null pointer references.
There are also warnings that certain variables were assigned but never
used, as well as other warnings that arguments are null. These warnings
are important for staying consistent in the program and making sure that
each variable is used correctly as well as no null values
being used.

The valgrind output means that there were no memory leaks found within the
program as well as o errors from 0 contexts without any of the errors being
suppressed. It does however give the bytes that are still reachable by the program,
which are...
  - 2,010
  - 2,522
  - 986
Valgrind also provides the total heap usage for each code block.
